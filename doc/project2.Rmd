Make sure to install all packages below before running any code; I installed them by running: 
```{r}
# install.packages('package') for each package listed.
```

Set ur directory. I set mine running this in the console:
```{r}
#setwd('Desktop/GitHub/ads-fall2023-project2-group2/doc/')
```

Load libraries
```{r load_libraries, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(udpipe)
library(plotly)
```

Read in data
```{r}
pathfile <- '../data/HousingAssistanceOwners.csv'
owner_data <- read.csv(pathfile)

pathfile_2 <- '../data/HousingAssistanceRenters.csv'
renter_data <- read.csv(pathfile_2)
```

```{r}
# calculate sum of each 
x1 <- sum(owner_data$approvedBetween1And10000)
x2 <- sum(owner_data$approvedBetween10001And25000)
x3 <- sum(owner_data$approvedBetween25001AndMax)
```

```{r}

```
